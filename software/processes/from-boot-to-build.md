# From Boot to Build

## Installing Android Studio

If Android Studio **Bumblebee** or higher is installed, you can skip this step. To determine the version, go to [determining-version](../android-studio/determining-version.md)

Follow Android Studio's [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) for instructions on how to install. Note that school Chromebooks **cannot** run Android Studio: the ChromeOS instructions on that page require Linux.
