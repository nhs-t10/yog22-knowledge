# Adding someone to GitHub

This should be done by a [Github admin](../people-to-ask-about-things/github-admin.md) at the request of any software member.

Ask the member for their GitHub username.

Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization) to add them to the `nhs-t10` organization. 

Always add them to the teams `Flow-ers` and `disciples`; add them to `LO2` if they're on LO2 and `t10-software` if they're on T10.
