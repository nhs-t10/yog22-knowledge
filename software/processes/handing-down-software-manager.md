# Handing Down "Software Manager"

This should be done by the former Software Manager after each Software Manager election.

1) Make the incoming software manager into an owner. Follow the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization#appointing-an-organization-owner).
2) Add them to the [Github Admin list](../people-to-ask-about-things/github-admin.md)
3) Make sure the incoming software manager can review the Processes so they know what they'll need to do next year.


## Picking a Successor

Over the course of the year, try to pick 1-3 potential successors. Try to teach them some of what they'll need. Remember that *they may not be voted in*, but they'll still be a great help to the manager.
