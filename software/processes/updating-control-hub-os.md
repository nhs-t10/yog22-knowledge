Updating the Control Hub's operating system can give additional hardware capabilities. Using a Windows computer with the [REV Hardware Client (free software)](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client), follow the [official documentation](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/android-device/installing-rc-ds-applications) to update the OS.

After updating the Control Hub OS, you may need to [update the FTC SDK](updating-ftc-sdk.md) to get any advantages.
