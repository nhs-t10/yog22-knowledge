# Glossary

## Commit
A commit is a set of changes made in Git. It's like a snapshot in time of the project. **Once a commit is made, it is EXTREMELY hard to undo it**

## Commit ID 
A Commit ID is a twenty-character semi-random hash that identifies a single commit in a Git project.

## Version Control System
A VCS helps to keep track of changes in a project over time. 


## Async Function
Javascript lets you do "kinda-multi-threading" *very* easily: all you need to do is `async function foo() { ... }` instead of `function foo() { ... }`. 

If you're calling an async function, you should await it: `var result = await foo()`.

## Javascript

A language that does everything better than Java, except for multithreading.
