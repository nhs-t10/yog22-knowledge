# Why CLI?

Why use the command-line interface for Git? Why not a GUI like GitHub Desktop or GitKraken? Why not the Android Studio git interface?

## 1) Universal

The command line is the same over *every* operating system. It's the same over every version. It's the same over every computer.

If everyone's using the command line, then Software Managers don't have to be familiar with 1000 Git interfaces: just one.

## 2) Available

The CLI is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and... anything. Other apps might be highly available, but nothing can *beat* the CLI.

## 3) Speedy

You don't have to wait a minute for it to boot up. It might take more to set up and learn the CLI, but after you have, it's *far* faster.

## 4) Standard

The CLI is the industry standard method for how to interface with Git.

## 5) Text

Since the CLI is only text, we don't have to have a ton of images in our documentation in order to describe it.
