# Someone Doesn't Have a Computer

## How to Identify

they'll usually tell you

## How to Fix

1) Get one of the lab computers. Try to get one of the *new* ones: they are **black** Dell laptops. They have a **yellow** label on the **front center** of the lid. If you can't get a new one, one of the **light grey** *old* laptops will work too.
	We typically don't have to ask Mr. Batra to use the *old* laptops, but ask for the *new* ones.
2) Bring the laptop to the person
3) Label the laptop with the person's name + " Robotics". If you are trained in using the label maker, try to use that; otherwise, use tape/marker.
	If you have time, ask Mr. Batra (or somebody listed in [label-maker](../../people-to-ask-about-things/label-maker.md)) how to use the label maker later. 
4) Tell the person the password. All of the passwords are the same: our **h**igh **s**chool's three-letter acronym. Some computers have it in lowercase, but most have it in all-caps. There are no spaces. Some computers may use "DVW" or "dvw".
5) Follow [from-boot-to-build](../../processes/from-boot-to-build.md) (or have the person follow it) to get the laptop ready to build.
